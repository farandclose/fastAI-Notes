    "Before we go into the code, let's think about how it would work. Broadly these are the three sets that we will follow:\n",

    "2. This pre-trained model is trained on a specific dataset of images\n",
    "3. We will test this newly trained model\n",

    "Let's go through them one by one:\n",
    "Getting a pre-trained model. There are many pre-trained image recognition models that are available. The one that you want to choose is the one that has least footprint with desired accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that you have found the model that you want to train. The question comes, how do you train it:\n",
    "1. Get the sample data that you want to train\n",
    "2. Divide the data into training set and validation set\n",
    "3. Training the model on the training set for a given number of iterations. These iterations are called epochs.\n",
    "4. After each Epoch, the system would check the accuracy of the trained model on the validation set.\n",
    "5. One way to define the number of iterations for training is to keep a close eye on the accuracy. We want to keep as many epochs that lead to improvement in accuracy."
